DebugPlus helps you debug your code by drawing 3d shapes and logs on screen.
When you add the plugin to your project, the class "DebugPlus" becomes available from anywhere in your code.
This is your only entry point to all DebugPlus features.

How to use it
-------------

You can draw any built-in Unity gyzmo like this:
    DebugPlus.DrawCube(center, size);
    DebugPlus.DrawSphere(center, radius);
    DebugPlus.DrawLine(start, end);
    DebugPlus.DrawRay(from, direction);
    DebugPlus.DrawMesh(...);
    DebugPlus.DrawWireCube(...);
    DebugPlus.DrawWireMesh(...);
    DebugPlus.DrawWireSphere(...);
    DebugPlus.DrawFrustum(...);
    DebugPlus.DrawGUITexture(...);
    DebugPlus.DrawIcon(...);

You can write logs directly on the screen like this:
    DebugPlus.LogOnScreen("this will appear on the game screen");

Optionaly, you can specify a duration, color and matrix in a fluent way like this:
    DebugPlus.DrawLine(start, end)
        .Duration(d)
        .Color(c)
        .Matrix(m);
    DebugPlus.LogOnScreen("this text will appear in red for 5 seconds)
        .Duration(5)
        .Color(Color.red);

You can also draw your own home-made gyzmo like this:
    DebugPlus.Draw(new Drawing(() =>
	{
	    // let's draw a wire triangle
		Gyzmo.DrawLine(aPoint, bPoint);
		Gyzmo.DrawLine(bPoint, cPoint);
		Gyzmo.DrawLine(aPoint, cPoint);
	}))
	.Color(c)
	.Duration(d);

* duration is given in seconds

Remimder : Unity allows you to draw gyzmos in the game screen in addition to the editor screen. Just check the toggle
button on top of the game tab.

How does it work
----------------

In Unity, you can draw gyzoms only by implementing OnDrawGizmos, and only in MonoBehavior classes. But Unity also provides
a line drawing feature in the Debug class. DebugPlus allows to draw all built-in Unity's gyzmos in the same way that Unity.Debug
is drawing line : anytime, anywhere by specifying only a color and a duration. DebugPlus also adds an optionnal matrix to deform
shapes like cubes or meshes.

To draw these gyzmos, DebugPlus creates a game object that implements the OnDrawGizmos methods for you, and manages the drawing
of the gyzmos over time. This game object is created only in play mode, if you call DebugPlus.


DebugPlus also creates a dedicated canvas where it is possble to draw text, because it's sometimes more handy to have a log on the screen,
not only on the console. The LogOnScreen methods works the same way than gyzmos : logs are drawn with a specified color and for
a specified duration over time. If the dedicated canvas messes with your existing GUI, please report it via email or on the official
forum (see below).

In absence of a duration, the gyzmos and logs are drawn only once on the next frame.
